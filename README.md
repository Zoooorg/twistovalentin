## Description of the project

This projest contains six main directories:

- The bin directory with all the executables.

- The doc directory contains information on the files used in the project.

- The src directory contains all the functions used for the executable.

- The test directory with the test functions.

- The include directory which contains the .h files required for the functions.

The aim of the project is to create a driver who will drive on a map given to him by the race manager and 
cover it as quickly as possible while managing his fuel and collisions with opponents.


### **HOW TO GENERATE THE PILOT :**

In the terminal of your computer, use the cd function to go at the main folder
(containing all the directories descrided previously) and type this command:
```
make all
```

If you want to install the driver in the directory of the race manager, you can type the command:
```
make install
```

Or if you want to launch directly the race manager with driver installed type this:
```
make try
```


### **HOW TO GENERATE THE TESTS :**

In the terminal of your computer, use the cd function to go at the main folder
(containing all the directories descrided previously) and issue this command:
```
make test
```

And to run the test of function used for the driver:
```
./test/bin/test
```


### **HOW TO GENERATE THE DOCUMENTATION :**

In the terminal of your computer, use the cd function to go at the main folder
(containing all the directories descrided previously) and issue this command:
```
make doc
```

The documentation will be created in the doc directory.

Wait an instant and use the command to see the documentation on firefox:
``` 
firefox ./doc/html/index.html &
```


### **HOW TO DELETE DOCUMENTATION :**

In the terminal of your computer, use the cd function to go at the main folder
(containing all the directories descrided previously) and issue this command:
```
make cleandoc
```


### **HOW TO DELETE THE FILES GENERATED BY THE TESTS :**

In the terminal of your computer, use the cd function to go at the main folder
(containing all the directories descrided previously) and issue this command:
```
make cleantest
```


### **HOW TO DELETE THE OBJECT FILES :**

In the terminal of your computer, use the cd function to go at the main folder
(containing all the directories descrided previously) and issue this command:
```
make clean
```


### **HOW TO DELETE ALL THE FILES GENERATED BY THE PROJECT :**

In the terminal of your computer, use the cd function to go at the main folder
(containing all the directories descrided previously) and issue this command:
```
make distclean
```
